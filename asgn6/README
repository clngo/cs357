This program is called the minimally useful shell 2
(mush2 for short). It's similar to the shell like
/bin/sh or /bin/csh, but not all the functionality
(hence, minimally useful). Unlike terminating programs, 
^C will not kill the shell (woo we learned SIGINT). 
Instead, ^D or typing "exit" will kill the shell, 
just like /bin/sh. 
make all and make mush2 both create the mush, but you
would need to have libmush.a and mush.h
make clean will remove mush2 program. 


I noticed on the asgn6 pdf, after running sleep 20 and 
interrupting with ^C, a new line is created for the 
prompt, just like /bin/sh. I also created a new line
after interrupting, but I did notice your mush2 program did 
not create a new line (/home/pn-cs357/demos/mush2). Just
difference in formatting, the functionality is what's
important.
Alas, the last assignment of this course has finally been
completed. I submitted using my mush2 program, which is
honestly pretty cool. 
Did you know, you could call the program inside
the program? It's possible to have the shell inside a shell,
you wouldn't know which shell you are in though unless you
keep count. It's pretty funny though, it's like recursion. 
I wish I participated more in class or came to office hours,
but who would've known all of your office hour times 
conflicted with my classes. At least we talked a bit during 
lab; I will remember your wedding requiring you to choose between 
blue or pink napkins (lol). 
Anyways, have fun grading this, we both get to enjoy our
winter break after this. Maybe bake some cookies for you 
and your family (I might bake some for myself too). 
Happy holidays!
