To make the file, type: make mytalk
or you could also type: make all
They both do the same thing; create the program.
If you want to turn on verbose, accept, or disable 
windows, you could use -v, -a, -N (respectfully).
These won't change the function of how each user talks
to each other, just optional features to have for fun.
Guess what? Mytalk talks! Well, specifically, it 
can you communicate to another person on another
server. You technically can't talk to yourself 
unless your on both ends of the server, which...
well, you'd only practically want to do that if you're
debugging (like myself). Even if the other person 
on the other end disconnects, the user will still be
connected to read the messages, just in case you still
wanted to read. My Mytalk works just like pnico Mytalk,
so you could use either program and you can... talk!

To be fair, this is one of the more interesting, if not
the most interesting assignments I've had in this class.
Besides the fact I could actually show it to my roomies,
I really did feel like I learned a lot. Too bad I feel
like I'm probably doing a lot of work too fast to really
learn everything, but at least I'm still learning :)
I also hope you don't feel too stressed out like I am;
everyone's in this together you know? Anyways, my program
works! I even tested the entire Bee Movie script.
