1. I am using unix4
2. vimtutor
3. I chose vi for no particular reason as I do not know emacs nor vi.
4. My program prints "Hello World". The problem I encountered was trying to save and compile the file. 
I should be careful about saving the file by ending with .c.

This going to take me a lot of practice to get into the habit of typing in vi. But it makes sense when
I finally know what I'm doing
