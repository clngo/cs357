For you to run this program, make sure you have an
input file. It uses the Makefile to compile my
C file. 

This code has successfully caused me to not only
compress this file, but compress my brain cells.
Unlike the compressed file, my brain cells can't 
be decompressed. In all seriousness, this was
difficult, but I learned a lot. Yet, did I learn
if I segmentation fault my brain?
