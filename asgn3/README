When you run the program, it runs :).
Seriously, you could put in an input with 
no output for hencode and it'll still work!
But... why? You can't even read it correctly.
Having the bits in stdout is just unreadable.
Well, just like in all code, it just works because
why not? Hdecode also works to decompress the file.
Make sure you have both commands for it. Again,
would be weird to have the bits in stdout...
even though it's possible.

Responding to your last comment on lab03, I did
listen to your advice and to reboot. And reboot
my brain as in I need some sleep now. Going to 
decompress all that compressed gunk from this week.
