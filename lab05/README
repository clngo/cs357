To create the file, type: make mypwd 
or you could also type: make all
They both do the same thing; create the file. 
To run the file, type ./mypwd
To remove the file, type: make clean
This will print your current working directory!
My code works, if it doesn't, then so does pwd,
meaning, you probably broke it lol.

If you can't grade, I'll accept cookies. I really
like chocolate chip and I haven't had them in a long
time. Fortunately I'm going home for Thanksgiving break,
maybe you can bake cookies for yourself and your family 
too. Anyways, there's a lot of if statements to check
errors, so hopefully I get good grade for that. 
Also, I didn't make my function recursive, so
I had to code my string so it appends to the front,
which isn't really what appending means...
In any case, it works, but in a very unique way.
Thank you.
